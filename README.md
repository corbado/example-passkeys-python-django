# Passkey-First Authentication with Flask and Corbado

## Project Overview

This project implements a web application with a login system using Corbado' passkey-first authentication service
integrated with a Flask backend. The application consists of two main pages: a login page and a home page. Once users
log in successfully via the Corbado service on the login page, they are redirected to the home page where they can log
out and view protected content.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, used to build the backend of the application.
- **Corbado**: An authentication service used to handle passkey-first user authentication.
- **Python-dotenv**: A Python package to read key-value pairs from a `.env` file and set them as environment variables.
- **HTML & CSS**: Used to structure and style the frontend of the application.

## Features

- **Passkey-first Authentication**: Utilizes Corbado's authentication service for secure user login.
- **Session management**: Uses Corbado's session management to display content based on the user's authentication status.
