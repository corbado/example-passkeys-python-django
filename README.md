# Passkey-First Authentication with Django and Corbado

## Project Overview

This project implements a web application with a login system using Corbado' passkey-first authentication service
integrated with a Django backend. The application consists of two main pages: a login page and a home page. Once users
log in successfully via the Corbado service on the login page, they are redirected to the home page where they can log
out and view protected content.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Django**: A full-featured Python web framework, used to build the backend of the application.
- **Corbado**: An authentication service used to handle passkey-first user authentication.
- **HTML & CSS**: Used to structure and style the frontend of the application.

## Features

- **Passkey-first Authentication**: Utilizes Corbado's authentication service for secure user login.
- **Session management**: Uses Corbado's session management to display content based on the user's authentication status.
